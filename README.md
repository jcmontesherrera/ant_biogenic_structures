## Project Data
- ROV imagery
	- Frontal ROV video
	- NADIR GoPro images & video
- Table of ROV depth & transect times
- Benthic cover annotations
- Habitat structural metrics

## Description of project
Habitat-forming organisms possess structural complexity that drive multiple ecosystem processes. There is a lack of knowledge and protocols on how to quantify Antarctic habitat-forming organisms structural complexity and associated species. This project aims to characterize the structural complexity of an Antarctic polychaete reefs, describe a protocol to acquire this data, and discuss monitoring implications.

## Sampling and processing methods
- Remotely Operated Vehicle
- Underwater cameras
- Structure from Motion photogrammetry
- Digital Elevation Model & GIS analysis
- R code developed by Fukunaga et al. (2019)
- Python with pandas and sklearn libraries
