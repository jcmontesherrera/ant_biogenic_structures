# Ellis Fjord - Polychaete Reef Structural Complexity

## Description of project
Habitat-forming organisms possess structural complexity that drive multiple ecosystem processes. There is a lack of knowledge and protocols on how to quantify Antarctic habitat-forming organisms structural complexity and associated species. This project aims to characterize the structural complexity of an Antarctic polychaete reef, describe a protocol to acquire this data, and discuss monitoring implications.
