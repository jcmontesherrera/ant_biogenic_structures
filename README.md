## Description of project
Habitat heterogeneity or structural complexity provides multiple ecosystem processes that drive biodiversity. There is a lack of knowledge of how much aggregations of polychaete colonies modify structural complexity and associated species. This project aims to characterize the structural complexity metrics that polychaete reefs and its relation with epifauna.

## Sampling methods
- Structure from Motion photogrammetry
- Digital Elevation Model & GIS analysis
- Python with pandas and sklearn libraries
